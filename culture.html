        <h2>Culture practices and values</h2>
       <p>The ideals of whakapapa (genealogy), mana (spiritual force), and whanaungatanga (relationships) are fundamental to Māori cultural traditions. The Māori people emphasize sustainable environmental stewardship, or kaitiakitanga, with considerable priority. Daily life is governed by the concepts of tapu (sacred) and noa (common), and traditional performance arts like as waiata and haka are essential for expressing cultural identity. The Māori language, Te Reo Māori, is an essential part of their culture, and powhiri rituals greet visitors to marae, which are important venues for community gatherings. A customary way of cooking called hangi, together with the Māori people's connection to their land and resources, highlight the importance of cultural traditions that have persisted over centuries, adding to the distinctive and colorful fabric of Māori culture.</p>
                <p>Māori cultural traditions are firmly anchored in a strong sense of whakapapa, the ancestral links and ancestry that help people identify who they are. Within Māori societies, the notion of mana—a spiritual power and authority gained by acts and leadership—is intricately linked to this ancestral heritage, impacting interpersonal relationships and decision-making. Whanaungatanga values highlight the significance of establishing and preserving relationships, which go beyond family ties to include shared experiences and a feeling of interdependence between people and communities.</p>
                <p>The Māori perspective is intrinsically tied to the environment by virtue of the kaitiakitanga concept, which underscores the need of conscientious management and guardianship of natural resources. The notion of tapu and noa, in which certain locations, items, or behaviors may have holy importance (tapu) or be a regular part of life (noa), is also understood from a holistic point of view. Māori people are guided in their relationships with the outside world by the careful balance between these states, which promotes harmony between people and their environment. Collectively, these cultural activities and traditions like haka, waiata, and powhiri add to the Māori culture's resilience and diversity, demonstrating a strong bond with their land and heritage.</p>
                <p>The Māori spirit is embodied by traditional expressions like as haka and waiata, which are potent tools for communicating narratives, feelings, and cultural identity. Powhiri and other ceremonial customs build a bridge that promotes harmony and understanding between Māori communities and outsiders. Māori not only maintain their legacy through these cultural practices and beliefs, but they also provide a deep insight into a worldview that balances the spiritual, social, and environmental aspects of their identity.</p>
